# QWOP - Genetic Algorithm Simulation

* A simple yet fun to watch simulation of QWOP-styled characters and mechanics learning how to walk a 50m run, all based on a genetic algorithm.

* The simulation's population as well as mutation chance can be customized at the game's menu. Other customizations are possible, but will require the project to be opened in Unity's Editor.

* Playable web version: https://gabrielmenezes.itch.io/qwop-genetic-algorithm-simulation
