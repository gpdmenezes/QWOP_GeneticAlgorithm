# QWOP - Genetic Algorithm Simulation

![Cover](https://github.com/gpdmenezes/QWOP_GeneticAlgorithm/assets/38543018/92bbf721-9fbc-42c5-ab81-11daa4edf754)

* A simple yet fun to watch simulation of QWOP-styled characters and mechanics learning how to walk a 50m run, all based on a genetic algorithm.

* The simulation's population as well as mutation chance can be customized at the game's menu. Other customizations are possible, but will require the project to be opened in Unity's Editor.
